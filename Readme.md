# ASPxGridView - How to manage stored files of different types


<p>This example demonstrates how to upload, view and edit (when it is possible) files with the ASPxGridView component. ASPxUploadControl implements file uploading in <a href="http://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/CustomDocument9886"><u>Advanced Upload Mode</u></a>, which requires Microsoft Silverlight v3 or later installed on the client side.  The DetailRow template is used to organize viewing end editing of uploaded files. Also, the standard edit form of the ASPxGridView control is replaced with a custom template as well. For more details see: <a href="http://demos.devexpress.com/ASPxGridViewDemos/GridEditing/EditFormTemplate.aspx"><u>Edit Form Template</u></a></p>
